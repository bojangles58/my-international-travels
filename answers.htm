    <div class="answer">
      <p>I would be most interested in pursuing a role in either Front End programming or Mobile App programming.</p>
      <p>Not only would I be in a position to teach these areas in school to my students, but I would also have another career
      option available to me.  However, outside of teaching, I would be really be interested in pursuing a career in Front End
      Programming because I would get the opportunity to learn different programing languages such as Javascript.</p>
      <p>
      </p><p>I would be able to create programmes that the user can happily interact with and I would be able to design website apps and see
      the results of my work being used to meet the individual needs of the user.</p>
      <p>
      </p><p>I have been disappointed with some of the mobile apps out there for android phones, the one's that I have downloaded from the play
      store never seem to perform in the way that they claim to be able to, and I always end up deleting them from my phone.</p>
